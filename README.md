Project Overview:
The Smart Fruit Grading System (SFGS) represents a groundbreaking initiative aimed at revolutionizing traditional fruit grading processes within the agricultural industry. By integrating cutting-edge technology, including computer vision and machine learning, the SFGS automates the grading and sorting of fruits based on parameters like size, ripeness, and quality.

Business Case
The business case advocates for the adoption of the SFGS as the preferred solution for addressing the challenges in manual fruit grading. It outlines significant efficiency gains, cost reductions, and long-term benefits associated with the SFGS. Despite initial high investment costs and ongoing maintenance expenses, the SFGS promises substantial savings and improved productivity over time.

Project Management Plan
The project management plan extends the business case, detailing the implementation and execution of the SFGS project. It encompasses both software and hardware aspects, outlining the project scope, timeline, and deliverables. Critical engineering decisions, software architecture, and third-party software components are highlighted to ensure system efficiency and adaptability.

Technical Details (Engineering Design Document):
Hardware Components: The SFGS incorporates a diverse array of hardware components, including servo motors, DC motors, and specialized cameras such as an X-ray camera.
Software Architecture: The software architecture operates on the Ubuntu 22.04 LTS operating system and features a layered structure comprising components like the User Interface (UI), AI model (Fine-Tuned DenseNet-201), and motion detection algorithm.
Integration of Third-Party Software: The system leverages third-party software components such as Python, PyTorch, NumPy, and OpenCV to enhance its capabilities in image processing and deep learning.

Anticipated Outcome
The SFGS promises to streamline fruit grading processes, eradicate manual intervention, and elevate efficiency and precision within the agricultural supply chain. With its tailored hardware specifications and layered software architecture, the SFGS stands as a beacon of technological advancement in agricultural technology.
